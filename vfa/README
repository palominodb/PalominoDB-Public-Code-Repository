DBA related scripts for managing client infrastructure

Installation instructions:

o To get this repo without a key from github run the following:

  ssh <username>@host
  mkdir git
  cd git
  git clone https://github.com/dturner-palominodb/dba.git


o Run create_perf_tarball.sh from git/dba.
  It will create /tmp/perf_tarball.tgz which
  can be copied to any host.

  cd ~/git/dba
  ./create_perf_tarball.sh

o Copy the file to db dest_host:/tmp

  scp /tmp/perf_tarball_20120820043003.tgz <hostname>:/tmp

o On the dest host open the tar file and run
  install_perf_tarball.sh.

  cd /tmp
  tar xzvf perf_tarball.tgz
  cd perf_tarball
  ./install_perf_tarball.sh

o Test that the script is working, type dba. This will source the vfa_lib.sh script.
  Your prompt should change. IE

  [dturner@host02-01 ~]$ dba
  [dturner@host02-01:3306 ~]#

o Files of interest

  /etc/vfatab
  
  The contents of the above file should resemble the following if you have multiple instances. Otherwise,
  only one line for 3306
 
  /etc/my-3306.cnf:3306:Y:Y    
  /etc/my-3307.cnf:3307:Y:N    
  /etc/my-3310.cnf:3310:Y:N    

o /etc/init.d/mysql
  /etc/init.d/mysqld

  Both are symlinks to /usr/local/palominodb/scripts/mysqld. This is a modified mysqld script that is used to work
  with multiple database instances. By default it will start or stop all instances. However, if a port is passed 
  it will start or stop the individual instance.

  /etc/init.d/mysql start 3307
